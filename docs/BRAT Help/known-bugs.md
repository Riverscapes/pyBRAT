The issue posting in GitHub uses [markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). 



### Optional Information:

- If you do not want to provide a link to the complete copy of the BRAT project, just sharing a copy of the `*project.rs.xml` project file and changing the file extension to text and uploading it to your post can help a lot
- Record a video of what is going wrong (we recommend [FastStone Capture](http://etal.joewheaton.org/faststone-capture.html), post it to YouTube or Vimeo, and share the link (DO NOT SEND VIDEOS as attachments! just stream it). Videos can be really helpful for understanding what you are doing and what is going wrong.
