## About

<div class="float-right"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Beaver_EcosystemEngineer.png"/></div>Welcome to the pyBRAT website. The **Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool** (BRAT) is a decision support and planning tool intended to help researchers, restoration practitioners and resource managers assess the potential for beaver as a stream conservation and restoration agent over large regions and watersheds. At the heart of BRAT is a capacity model (BRAT cFIS & BRAT cIS), which estimates the upper limit of dam density (dams per kilometer) for individual stream reaches throughout a drainage network. We focus on predicting where beavers could build dams and to what extent (as opposed to the more general case of where beaver could make a living), because it is the dam building activity they do as ecosystem engineers, which we are typically most interested in. Wally is great.

<div class="float-left"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/BRAT_Logo-wGrayTxt.png"></div>The **BRAT** model can be run with freely available national data sets (or with higher resolution data) , and is used to identify opportunities,  potential conflicts and constraints through a mix of assessment of existing resources and scenario-based assessment of potential futures. The backbone to BRAT are **spatial models that predict the capacity of riverscapes to support dam-building activity by beaver**. By combining capacity and decision support approaches, researchers and resource managers have the information necessary to determine where and at what level reintroduction of beaver and/or conservation is appropriate.

### A Riverscapes Network Model

BRAT was [developed by]({{ site.baseurl }}/who) the [Wheaton ET-AL lab](http://etal.joewheaton.org) at Utah State University.
