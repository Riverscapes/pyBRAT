Thank you for your interest in BRAT. **As of Fall, 2018, the BRAT model and documentation is undergoing a major overhaul (anticipated updates by Winter 2019). Thank you for your patience in navigating these pages while we clean up our documentation.** 

Please note that while  BRAT is freely available and reasonably thoroughly documented, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll find everything you need to make it work for you or that what we have meets your needs. We try to provide as many resources as possible for free to help you 'do it yourself'.
