Thank you for your interest in BRAT. **As of Fall, 2018, the BRAT model and documentaton is undergoing a major overhaul (anticipated updates by Winter 2019). Thank you for your patience in navigating these pages while we clean up our documentation.** 

Please note that while  BRAT is freely available and reasonably thoroughly documented, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll find everything you need to make it work for you or that what we have meets your needs. We try to provide as many resources as possible for free to help you 'do it yourself'. However, if you need more help, it is availble by contacting the right organizations and individuals listed below.    


## Free Support

The BRAT is reasonably well documented. See links below for help on understanding [BRAT Concepts]({{ site.baseurl }}/Documentation/Concepts), [Tutorials]({{ site.baseurl }}/Documentation/Tutorials) on how to use specific BRAT features, and docuemntation on [BRAT Command References]({{ site.baseurl }}/Documentation/Commands).

# Community Support

## BRAT Workshops & Courses

We teach [BRAT workshops]({{ site.baseurl }}/Documentation/Workshops) on occasion and those materials are available for reference. There are no specific courses taught publicly on BRAT, but  [Joe Wheaton](http://joewheaton.org) does cover BRAT in courses at Utah State University:
-  Design Capstone in Management and Restoration of Aquatic Ecosystems ([WATS 5340](https://restoration-usu.github.io/WATS-5340-5350/Course_Topics/WATS_5340/2_Assessing_Condition.html)) 
- Partnering with Beaver in Restoration Design ([WATS 6860](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/2018---usu-wats-6860.html))

## Issue Forum 

We use GitHub [Issue tracking](https://github.com/Riverscapes/pyBRAT/issues) as a forum for [asking questions and getting help]({{ site.baseurl }}/Documentation/known-bugs#questions-or-help) as well as [reporting bugs]({{ site.baseurl }}/Documentation/known-bugs#bugs). You can search the forum for past issues without a login, but to post to the forum you will need to create a [free Github account](https://github.com/join). **WE encourage users to search the forum first if you have questions. If you email us, we'll generally reply by pushing the conversation up on to the issue forum so it can benefit other users.**

## BRAT Datasets

For the projects that we have performed for clients, we provide the [BRAT datasets here]({{ site.baseurl}}/BRATData).

# Paid Support

While the pyBRAT scripts are free, open-source and reasonably well docuemented, it is not perfect, and you get what you pay for.  Unlike our more mature models (e.g. [GCD](http://gcd.riverscapes.xyz)) that have full GUIs and ArcGIS Add-Ins, pyBRAT is a highly finicky series of ArcPy Toolboxes and scripts, that are very version sensitive (to both version of ArcGIS and Python), and with rather narrow workflows that have been tailored to how we typically run BRAT in the [ETAL lab](http://etal.joewheaton.org). If you are someone that has funded the development of BRAT, thank you! If you have [sponsored the develoment]({{ site.baseurl }}/acknowledgements) of specific features or hired us to carry out specific research, we make sure you get exactly what you need. If you've downloaded the free scripts and are using it to do something, and you [find a bug and report it]({{ site.baseurl }}/Documentation/known-bugs#bugs), we try to fix it to the extent we can and we have funding support to do so. The dirty secret about open-source software, very few users take the time to contribute back to the cause by contributing their improvements to the code (though we like the idea), and someone paid for this.  If you're interested in seeing new features added to BRAT or having our development team build custom features or apps to meet your needs, get in touch.

</div>

None of the BRAT development or support happens without someone paying for it (contrary to popular belief, we get no support from our University employers for supporting this effort and capable students don't work for free). When we are lucky enough to have secured [research grant funding]({{ site.baseurl }}/support)) from NSF or NERC (for example), they provide temporary financial support for us to provide techncial support to users at no cost. However, everything else is on our personal time and personal dime.  We try to help out users where we can, but our  development and support team is in high demand.  If you want to ensure you get the help you need when you need it, you can  hire an [USU ETAL](http://etal.joewheaton.org)  analyst to help you with your BRAT analysis, designing monitoring campaigns or helping you with your research.
