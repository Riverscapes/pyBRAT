- A spreadsheet with the HUC8 basins with major rivers crossing into them and the upstream DA values can be found on Box [here](https://usu.box.com/s/r820gmob2qavx9dwprebker27ff69bu2).

- There is a spreadsheet with the baseflow and 2-yr flow regression equations and basin-specific input variable values that can be accessed from [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MoLq0Jvd4iaEiWHsOf3ULEk-oWtZzluv6eiAscM77ws/edit?usp=sharing) or from [Box](https://usu.box.com/s/k9eizpu28u9gnmn9rb5zpijr7vglqg8b) if you have credentials.

- - The 2-yr flow regional regression equations come from [this](https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2012/5113/) USGS technical document.  The baseflow regional regression equations were calculated by the FHC due to a lack of equations for California.
