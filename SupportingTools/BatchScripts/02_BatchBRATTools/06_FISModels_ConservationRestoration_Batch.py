# Name: FIS Models & Conservation Restoration Model (Batch)
#
# Purpose: Runs Vegetation Capacity Model, Combined Capacity Model, and Conservation Restoration
#           Model for multiple HUC8s
#
# Notes:       - The scripts assumes data are in standard BRAT project
#                folder and file structure.  Specifically:
#                i) individual basin folders (e.g., Applegate_17100309) are directly
#                   under the user defined parent folder (typically the 'wrk_Data' folder)
#               ii) BRAT table output is located in standard location within basin run folder
#                   If inputs are named otherwise, the code will need to be slightly modified to
#                   find the proper files. All basin inputs should have the same name.
#               - The script will execute on all subfolders in the parent folder EXCEPT
#                 those that start with a '00_*' (e.g., '00_Projectwide')
#               - The tool expects an input CSV with the following columns and calculated values for each basin:
#                       - HUC8Dir -- must match basin sub-directory exactly (e.g., BigChicoCreekSacramentoRiver_18020157)
#                       - DA_Threshold -- values corresponding to the drainage area thresholds used in the Combined FIS (see website - http://brat.riverscapes.net/Documentation/Tutorials/7-BRATCombinedFIS.html)
