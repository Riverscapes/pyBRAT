This is the Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool (pyBRAT) source code and [documentation](http://brat.joewheaton.org) about it. pyBRAT is superseded by [sqlBRAT](http://tools.riverscapes.net/BRAT)

The documentation was previously on [http://brat.joewheaton.org](http://brat.joewheaton.org), and will now be accessed at [http://brat.riverscapes.net](http://brat.riverscapes.net).

The last stable release of pyBRAT (with ArcPy 10.x depenencies) was 3.1.0 ([latest realease](https://github.com/Riverscapes/pyBRAT/releases/latest)) and that was also published as: 

- Jordan Gilbert, Joe Wheaton, Wally Macfarlane, & Margaret Hallerud. (2019). pyBRAT - Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool (Python) (3.1.0). Zenodo. DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.7086388](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7086388)

A Riverscapes Consortium [Report Card for v 3.1.00 is available here](http://brat.riverscapes.net/Documentation/Status/Tool_ReportCard_3-1-00.html). 

## Next Versions
Note pyBRAT as an ArcGIS toolbox is no longer supported as we have shifted our development focus to a Production-Grade [sqlBRAT](http://tools.riverscapes.net/BRAT) and ESRI is sunsetting support for 10.X. sqlBRAT is currently a command-line tool.
